# Game Of Life
### Introduction
This is a implementation of 2 players [Conway's Game of life]. The Game of Life is played on a grid of cells, where each cell is either dead or alive. For each “turn” or “generation” of the game, the game iterates over all of the cells and determines whether a cell is alive or dead based on a set of rules. 
The rules for the standard single player version are as follows:
  - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (under population) 
  - Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives.
  - Any live cell with more than three neighbors dies (over population)
  - Any dead cell with exactly three neighbors becomes a live cell.
